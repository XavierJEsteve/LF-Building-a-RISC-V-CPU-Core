## Welcome

To get started, install the makerchip ide using python via 

```bash
pip3 install makerchip-ide
makerchip <filename>.tlv
```

At this time, there are no course corrections or platform issues to report. Please do let us know within the EdX platform if anything gets in your way. There's a great deal of infrastructure to maintain for the course, and we aim to keep it all running smoothly. Now, back to EdX.
